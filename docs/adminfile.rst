The Admin File
==============

The :ref:`mass-circular-weighing-welcome` program needs to keep track of 'housekeeping' details such as the client name,
address, and weights to be calibrated.  The simplest way to view and edit this information is in an Excel spreadsheet.
The *admin.xlsx* file also provides a convenient place to enter the weighing scheme, such that it is automatically
loaded into the program along with the administrative details.

To set up an *admin.xlsx* file for the :ref:`mass-circular-weighing-welcome` program, an example is provided in
mass_circular_weighing/utils/default_admin.xlsx.  Note that this file also includes a reference to where the
*config.xml* file is to be found (see :ref:`configfile`).
