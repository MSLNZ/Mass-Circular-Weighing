mass-circular-weighing
======================

Write the documentation for **mass-circular-weighing**.



Getting Started
---------------

To add new equipment (except balances), add the appropriate details to the `Equipment` sheet in the *Equipment Register*.
If the new equipment is a balance, add the appropriate details to the `Balances` sheet in the *Balance Register*,
and assign some initial acceptance criteria in the `AcceptanceCriteria` sheet.

Allowed weighing modes for balances are:

* mde	(manual data entry) 	no computer interface
* mw	(manual weighing) 	manually loaded, with computer interface to balance
* aw	(automatic weighing)	computer interfaces to weight changer and balance

For aw balances, enter the number of available weighing positions in the # pos column,
and the address of the weight changer (Arduino) in the WC_Address column.
Enter the Omega logger sensor in the Ambient monitoring column following the format for other entries.

.. note::
   This program does not allow for weighings using a beam balance.

To add equipment connections to a new computer, please start a new sheet for that computer in the Equipment Register
and copy the layout from another connections sheet (e.g. PDM Connections).
Please close the Register when youâ€™ve made your changes so that it is available for others to work on.
